                TL;DR Summarizer is a simple web app developed using the
                <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask framework</a> that performs automatic summarization
                of text and web pages. It provides several unique features:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="/">TL;DR Summarizer</a>: copy-paste an article or URL to
                        be summarized.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="/quickipedia">Quickipedia</a>: interactively search for Wikipedia
                        articles and read their summaries.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Newsflash: get a brief summary of the latest news from your favourite websites [coming soon].
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                The app was originally built to showcase the capability of the
                <a href="https://github.com/jaijuneja/PyTLDR">PyTLDR module</a> for Python, which is available
                as open source. It offers three distinct summarization algorithms based on academic research
                from the past decade. You can read more about these algorithms and their implementation
                <a href="https://github.com/jaijuneja/PyTLDR">here</a>.
